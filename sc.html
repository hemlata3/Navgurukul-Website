                <h2> Who this Programme is for </h2>
            </div>
            <div class="bc">
                <p>Rima is a 36 year old woman who was trafficked at a young age, never went to school, and has now been in the sex trade for as long as she can remember. Hemlata is an HIV positive woman whose in-laws abandoned her after discovering the disease and is now homeless. Shalu falsely took the blame to protect her boyfriend in a battery allegation case, and spent 3 yrs in Tihar. What’s common between all three? They all believe that it is their fault and this is the end of life for them, and these circumstances cannot be changed.</p><br>
                <p>School of Second Chances is a residential learning program initiated at NavGurukul designed specifically for women who have survived trauma in life and may have limited-to-none literacy. The school in its pilot in 2024 will offer a <strong>Super Chef course to 10 women in our residential campus in Pune.</strong></p>

                <h2> Course Duration </h2>
            </div>
            <div class="bc">
                <p> The program is entirely self-paced with an average duration of 12 to 18 months. Progression may depend upon the woman’s pre-existing learning levels and grasping capacity. Some women might be able to progress to employment within 6 to 8 months while others may take longer than 18 months too. We will continue to invest in their learning till the time they are skilled enough to earn at least Rs. 20k per month </p>

            </div>
            <div class="bc">
                <p>Being well versed in English, digitally literate and having a solid understanding of multi-cuisine cooking and nutrition could open up job opportunities like: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Working as a Chef in high-income households</li>
                    <li>Support to start their own businesses such as tiffin services, organic food delivery, etc. both in terms of initial support to raise funds and acquiring paying customers</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="de">
                <p>Our aim is to provide jobs of at least Rs. 20k per month. But, the actual income can be much higher than 20k per month based on the abilities of the candidate. As households are spending more and more on delivering services to eat a variety of food, and getting more and more aware about the health issues from the approach, there’s an increased demand of such chefs in affluent households, who can balance diversity of what’s being served with nutrition</p>

                <h2> Why Residential Mode at Our Camouses? </h2>
            </div>
            <div class="bc">
                <p> Immersion fosters growth. Our residential program provides a supportive environment, making it accessible for women who may not be able to afford accommodation or transport on their own, and also enables them to spend rigorous disciplined time towards their end goal. Our Pune campus is home to about 100 students in programming and business courses, with a culture of learning which will fuel motivation for these women as well which otherwise may be difficult to replicate in a new space. Eventually, our alumni will be equipped to bring this transformative experience to different communities.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>To enroll women from marginalized groups like shelter home residents, sex workers, HIV positive women, reformed prisoners, and more. Reaching deeper into the blind spots and boundaries of our society with every new student.</li>
                    <li>Introducing more courses like the Super-Nanny course that will focus on infant care and early-childhood development expertise.</li>
                    <li>To develop a lean (low-resource) and easy-to-understand open source program that can be adapted and executed by different organizations and government bodies. The women themselves would be able to take charge of it without a lot of dependency on the facilitators.</li>
                    <li>Development of a platform to support these women to find flexible work to suit their requirements and support their entrepreneurship ideas like a tiffin service with organic food, etc., by identifying customers through Samyarth Cooperative.</li>
